# Case Study Group Assignment
### Landon Burtle

## Q1. What problems is the organization facing?
### The school districts are wasting billions of dollars nationwide on learning softwares that may not be effective towards the purpose they try to solve.
### One issue that the organization is facing is that it only has a small, limited data set to showcase the capabilities of the model. The data is also not in a form that is useful to the model. The responses were not providing detailed feedback that would give useful insight.

## Q2. What is the target variable? What type of solution are they developing?
### The target variable is the effectiveness or impact of the software. The solution is a classification / discrete solution because it is choosing what the best software is, which is not a numeric output.

## Q3. How would they know the solution is working?
### They would know it is working if the schools are individually improving academically in mathematics and the cost is optimized make the most of their investments / no money is wasted in being put towards the wrong areas.

## Q4. What other issues might the team be facing?
### The team might be struggling to make the software effective for every school / district since they have different sets of needs and values that could effect what kind of solution is necessary to see the same positive results. If the software was offering the same solutions to every school, not every school would see positive results. The same issue applies for expanding the scope of the audience to other parts of the nation where maybe issues like fund allocation does not need to be addressed as much as other issues.

## Q5. How difficult is the data to gather?
### The data is moderately difficult to gather in this scenario because it relies on surveys where the answers can vary greatly and have no standard form. It can be hard to convert them into a standardized data point which is easy to manipulate and analyze. Also it is likely that not everyone in the school would answer the survey so it might not cover every detail that needs to be taken into consideration.

## Q6. Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
### Yes it is difficult to measure since not all of its impacts can be recorded or measured. This can include how well students actually retain information and whether it is enjoyable. It can be observed from the subsequent grades of the students, but since there is no follow-up survey, only the academic performance is shown as the result of the solution. 

## Q7. What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?
### I would define the bounds of success as significant improvement in academic performance where the needs displayed in the survey are accurately addressed by the model in its decision of a new software. It doesn't have to be a perfect solution, but as long as it reaches roughly the benchmark that the school was aiming for, then it is successful.
